Placing of a stage. 
Film as an entry point to artefacts. 

Storytelling is an important element to how a museum is configured, different rooms, galleries and display cases tell a story with the objects that they show. You follow a factual narrative thread through the objects that you look at, these objects can be thought of as props and as the motivators for great plots, narratives and stories. 

Considering this, Mise-en-scène is an investigation into how museum artefacts are also part of fictional narratives and film. Seeing this as an opportunity for creating new dialogues both within the world of museology, and between museology and different realms. 

Each scene within a film can be thought of as a gallery space, everything in any one shot has been thoughtfully curated and deliberately dressed as such. Hence, mise-en-scène. The placing of a stage.
Because museum collections and archives are part of the creative commons, together with other repositories of online documentation and imagery, there is the ability to be able to find matches for objects which are props within the film. This could perhaps be linking back to the source objects, which actually inspired many of these film-makers to create these fantasy worlds.

The making of a film is an art form, whereby every element is created and carefully placed in order to support the world that you are entering as an audience. It is this intense labour that makes a film flow smoothly and allows the viewer to ‘believe’. By drawing attention to the objects in films, the digital exhibition highlights these hidden roles. The intense labour of the researchers, buyers, prop makers, set dressers, graphics team, costume designers, set designers, production designer or art director that go into making the set of the film.

Mise-en-scène, is at the same time a proposal for a different way of looking at things and a different way to address the agency of the objects which pass us by.
