An amphora may be one of the most ubiquitous objects displayed in a museum. These ceramic vessels with their curvy bodies and two handles have been exhibited, studied, produced and reproduced for centuries, dating back to early antiquity. They are frequently used as ethnographic tools because ceramics are virtually indestructible and ‚Äúindividual pots and their painted decoration can be studied in detail to answer questions about religion, daily life and society.‚Äù

In 2015, another kind of amphora was added to the long history of this object in digital form ‚Äì üè∫the amphora emoji üè∫. 

Given the vast number of amphorae we encounter in museums ‚Äì the MET alone has over 1000 ‚Äì it is hard to look past the archetypal shape and see it in more detail. We end up treating the physical amphorae like like the emoji amphora as a symbol of antiquity or a vessel.  However, if we look beyond the iconic shape of amphorae there is a wealth of narrative and symbolic language.  

AMPHOJI pairs amphora from museums‚Äô collections with emoji to playfully allow for new readings and closer inspection of museums‚Äô collections. Using a collage style technique of placing the equivalent emoji symbols over the amphorae‚Äôs symbols or images the small details and historical visual language are translated into a contemporary visual language that we can read them fluently and connect with emotively. By showing the emoji as compositions, isolated from the vases before revealing the vases, the symbols can be read in isolation from the iconic vase shape that frequently dominates our interpretation of the object.

AMPHOJI is part of [Lara Chapman](https://www.lara-chapman.com)‚Äôs larger research project ‚ÄòThrough the Emoji Looking Glass‚Äô which brings various museological and art objects into conversation with emoji to examine the symbolic language, politics and curatorial conundrums that traverse both digital and physical visual collections.
