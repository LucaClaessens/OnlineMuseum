‘stockholm-font.stl’ is an exhibition and digital gift shop which only exhibits one artefact. 

‘stockholm-font.stl’ is the 3D scan of an artefact at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, which bears the name ‘Copy of a Font’. ‘Copy of a Font’ is a plaster cast of a font depicting carvings of human faces and animal heads surrounding the base of the font and tendrils, bunches of grapes and leaves decorating the bowl. It is one of several Scandinavian plaster casts acquired by the Museum from Sweden in the 1880s, the original font dates from the 12th century.

‘Copy of a Font’ was scanned by Jon Beck from Scan the World, in March 2015 and uploaded to Scan the World.org, where it is a freely downloadable .stl file. Fiona Herrod then downloaded the .stl file in October 2019, and began to research into what the purpose of having these files open source could mean. Is it a way to democratise access to museum content? Or can museum artefacts become something new? Having found  a way to digitally manipulate and reconfigure the object, it became a series of new objects- a collection of household items. 

In the age of the digital craftsman, every artifact can be reimagined and re-made. Seeing as museum objects are property of the public, this methodology offers a way to reclaim the artifacts. 

Especially seeing as a significant amount of the objects we go to look at in museums were not intended to be merely looked at and have functions of their own. The old function of an object could be re-awoken or new ones created. The new 3d files are freely downloadable too- for others to use and to even re-configure if they want to.
