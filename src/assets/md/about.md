The Online Museum is an online platform which functions as both a museum and as an on-going research project into ways that online museums can be configured.

The platform presents different ways that content (collections, objects, artworks etc) can be displayed online. It is an on-going exploration into the ways a ‘museum’ and digital exhibitions can function when it exists within the digital realm and is located online. The Online Museum is a framework, which expands with every new contribution for how the online museum could be. 

The content for the Online Museum is ‘borrowed’ from other museums, who have uploaded images of their collections to the internet, with creative commons licencing. Once these images are in creative commons, the internet and the Online Museum functions as the connecting medium between these different collections; new connections can be made and different ways of looking at cultural heritage emerge. A large part of the value of these online images is the ease at which they can circulate - they are not fixed to a location or quantity.
