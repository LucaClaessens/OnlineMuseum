For the Online Museum’s opening exhibition Still Life With ‘_____’, Seven Clicks takes its place as the first exhibition, starting always with the topic ‘Still Life’. But the route you take from there can be diverse and surprising.

Seven Clicks is  a creative research tool that takes you on a path through the vast and connected knowledge base of Wikipedia. The tool stimulates broad thinking and creativity by taking the user from the ‘obvious path’ to unexpected, yet related subjects. The result is a seven-page glossary, containing the seven chosen topics, which can then be saved or shared with others.

Wikipedia is arguably the biggest accumulation of knowledge on the internet, it is where we end up for quick fact checking or learning more about something. 
It contains more than 40 million articles, which are created, maintained and reviewed by members of the Wikipedia community.
In that way, Wikipedia is the museum, the Wikipedia community are the curators/mediators and those that read the articles are the visitors. The sheer amount of information available can be overwhelming and complex to navigate through, the way that Wikipedia works is you can navigate from article to article through clicking hyperlinks. Meaning you create your own ‘narrative trail’, similar to the discovery that happens when you visit an encyclopedic museum.
