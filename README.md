# üèõ The Online Museum

This repository contains the source code for The Online Museum, an online museum curated and maintaned by [Fiona Herrod](http://fionaherrod.com/).



## Development

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Types
Types are present in `src/types.d.ts`. Currently all types are present in the same declaration file. In case of future development these might be split up into multiple namespaces for separation of concerns. Currently no backend logic is needed as no data is aggregated / backend functions are implemented.

## Deployment

* [x] Run `npm run deploy:dev` to deploy to the development environment.

* [ ] Run `npm run deploy:prd` to deploy to a production environment.

#### Environments
* [ ] Environment settings can be configured via `src/environments`.
